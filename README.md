# Simple task manager for browsers

This is a fun PET project using **classic HTML/CSS/JS stack** where I do React things without React itself just because I'm curiuous ;-)

## Watch deployed app

[Right here!](https://curillaenator.github.io/vanila-ts-app/)

## Main goal of the app is me practicing

- DOM manipulations
  > initial index.html is empty, DOM is fulfilled via scripts
- application design patterns
  > singleton, state, observer, fabrics... atempted to do it right without any frameworks!
- Class UI components
  > every UI element in DOM is controlled class component appending to DOM when required

## Stack is bare minimum

- Webpack
- HTML
- CSS/Sass modules
- Typesript

## Dev environment

- Babel
  > as Typescript compiler
- Husky + Lint-staged
  > as Elisnt/Prettier runner to prevent me commiting slappy code =)
- Yarn 3
  > to have useful features while package managing

## Local run

**You probably will need .env to run it localy**

- yarn
- yarn start
